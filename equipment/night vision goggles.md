# Your Project Name
Vision

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**
TBD (1 so far, may have a second)

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
Yes:) Personally I've worked on PCB design for co-op but I've never actually created something for practical use.

**What you are making?**
The idea is night vision goggles that you can flip on and off your head (one-eyed or two-eyed). Similar to something the military would use.

**Inspiration:**
Firstly, I was inspired by all those video games where night vision goggles are an ability. They're pretty cool and it would be so much cooler to have one to use in real life. Secondly, I was inspired by my chemistry teacher who taught us about the light spectrum and electrons and blah blah blah, I had this idea in my head as a project for school but I was too afraid to tackle it. For this hackathon, I hope it would work out:) Otherwise my group will have to find an alternative :,)

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
